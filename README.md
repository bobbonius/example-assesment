# To Do Assessment

Hey there!

Great you're taking on this assessment. Down below you'll learn about all the details and what is expected.

We've given you a half finished To Do App. The goal is to improve the To Do app keeping the following requirements in mind:

- The app is in TypeScript, so that should stay that way.
- Focus on improving the UI as it looks kinda messy right now (some buttons take up the entire width of a container for example). You're allowed to use the packages which are installed. However, it's important you share some of your knowledge with us such as basic CSS styling. There are CSS modules in the project you can use for that.
- Its already possible to _add_ and _delete_ a to do item. We would like to be able to edit a to do item as well though.
- When a task is complete, you should be able to mark it as complete. The UI should update accordingly by striking through the title.

So the key things we're looking for is use of TypeScript (there is some incorrect typing going on somewhere which will prevent the app from building for example), semantic html and CSS. Like we mentioned in the beginning, the app is half fininshed. Try to make it so at least all requirements are met.

You should be able to make significant improvements within 3 hours. You can go the extra mile if you want to show of other stuff like: adding tests, refactor the "back-end", implement a CI/CD with GH Actions or whatever you can come up with. But don't feel pressured into doing so, it's the extra mile.

Best of luck!
